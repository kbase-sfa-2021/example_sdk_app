- Test optional parameters
- Refine KBase tests, perhaps with assert statements
- Add comments to explain what is going on and why things are done this way.

## Intro

This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the
[KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)][kb_sdk].

[kb_sdk]: https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk

You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).

You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/example_kb_sdk_app) or its [spec file]($module_name.spec).

# Setup and test

Add your KBase developer token to `test_local/test.cfg` and run the following:

```bash
$ make
$ kb-sdk test
```

After making any additional changes to this repo, run `kb-sdk test` again to verify that everything still works.

# Installation from another module

To use this code in another SDK module, call `kb-sdk install example_kb_sdk_app` in the other module's root directory.
